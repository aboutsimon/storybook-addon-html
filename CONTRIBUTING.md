## Repository Structure

This repository makes use of [Yarn Workspaces][yarn-workspaces] to install the
dependencies for both the library itself _and_ the example applications found in
the `examples` directory.

You can find the source code for the library within the `addon` directory.

Example applications -- which are useful for verifying changes -- can be found
within `examples`.

## Getting Started

Once you have the repository cloned, you'll want to install the dependencies
using

```
yarn install
```

This will take care of setting up everything you need to get started!

## Building the library

The library source is found within `addon`; referenced sub-directories or
commands in this section are relative to that directory.

The source-code for the library can be found within the `src` sub-directory.
Babel is used to compile the output to the adjacent `dist` directory, which is
_not_ part of version control. This can be done by running

```
yarn build
```

Additionally, files exist within the root of the library that re-export code
from the `dist` directory. This allows for nice clean imports for users of the
library without them needing to know about the `dist` directory.

## Running Example Apps

You can run `yarn start` from within any of the example applications to start
Storybook with the library added to it. This can be helpful for checking that
changes to the library look correct!

## Publishing Releases

TBD!
